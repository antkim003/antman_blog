Today, I was able to work through the code to get the tags to work correctly on the blog site. Not much time to program today. 

I should apply some of javascript/jQuery knowledge to create a categorizer that will toggle dynamically between certain topics on the archive page. As far as I know, this will require both jQuery and AJAX to display the data without reloading the page. I'll have to look at someone else's source code to figure this out. [mottr.am](https://github.com/mottram/mottram) has this functionality enabled on their archives page. 

**Questions I need to find answers to:**

-  Is there spell check when you use markdown?
-  Is there a way to automatically upload blog posts using jekyll without connecting to an FTP?
