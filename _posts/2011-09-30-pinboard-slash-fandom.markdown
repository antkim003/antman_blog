Apparently, [Delicious](http://delicious.com) (n√©e del.icio.us) was awfully popular with [fandom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom) types, especially the ones who enjoy [slash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction) fiction.

So, when the men who invented YouTube completely and utterly ruined the once-great service, breaking tags with a `/` in them in the process, the fandom people jumped ship--no [pun][0] intended--to [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in), a superior bookmarking service.

Next, the fandom people set up [a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oqfHHkO48fVFY3sPQqkoCuqFnQOWe4fxRxXJ-lUglg/edit?hl=en_US&pli=1) so they could collaborate on feature requests. Maciej, the bloke who made Pinboard, joined in, answering questions and offering tips.

Impressed, one of the fandom people wrote [a piece of slash fiction](http://archiveofourown.org/works/258626) about an anthropomorphised Pinboard lothario shagging an anthropomorphised fandom community, making an anthropomorphised Delicious jealous. Amazing.

This is such a perfect storm of arcane web culture, pervy strangeness and general nerdery that I _almost_ don't care that Pinboard's '[popular](http://pinboard.in/popular/)' page is now completely swamped with links to cringeworthy short stories about, I dunno, Dumbledore inappropriately touching Wesley Crusher.
