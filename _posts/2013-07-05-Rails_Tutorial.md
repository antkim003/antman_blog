Finally finished uploading my first hompage onto my own server and domain! Although progress is a little bit slow, I'm finally getting the understanding the big picture of HTML and CSS and how the web really works.

I'll continue to add pages to all of the nav bar links and continue to build upon the website. I'm currently torn between if I should continue with Ruby on Rails tutorial or to get a better understanding of jquery/javascript. Whatever I decide, I'll continue to keep learning.
