Started the codeschool modules on jQuery... it’s definitely a review and in some sense, a more indepth coverage jQuery. I think MM was a little dated on certain things you can do with jQuery. Still, it’s good to have that background moving forward. In general, the concepts and syntax are getting more complicated. It’s not as easy to wrap my head around some of the concepts, or why some syntax is written the way it is. Following jennifer dewalt’s blog, I’m starting to grasp conceptually how to go about making some of the different things shes making.

I think its time to start my own projects!

First off, today’s task list for programming:
<li>finish codeschool jquery modules</li>
<li>research different blog interfaces and create a new design for my site</li>
<li>and of course doing regular cardiotronic work</li>
