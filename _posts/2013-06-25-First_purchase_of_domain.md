today, i finally committed to pursuing a career in development.... I am going to document all my thoughts and actions in this whole journey. 

I bought my first domain name and registered with a webhost off hostmetro.com! www.projectantman.com. it doesn’t do anything right now, but definitely will have some promise soon.. $60....

So after talking to Dan, he suggested I make a homepage. I’m guessing he meant from scratch or as close to scratch as I could...

I realized I have a straight idea on how to this... couple of the first questions that come up seem so stupid: 

Am I supposed to install a framework into my server?? 
Is it supposed to be done through pure html code??
how do i upload or edit code?? 
I wonder how it ties into what I’m doing with rails tutorial?? Can I use that to create/edit homepages with the same capabilities if I were to build it up from scratch??

Thank the lord for the internet! I think I’ll be a little closer as I answer these questions...

On a sidenote... I’ll try to push through the rails tutorial and finish by the end of this weekend.
