Finished the MM yesterday. I think I have a rough understanding of the concepts on how webpages are made to be dynamic using JS and jQ. I can vaguely see how I can create the webpages that I want. I guess the next step now is to start creating some stuff! First off, I should use all the jQ plugins from the tutorial to my website. 

Iâ€™ll write some of the things I want to accomplish in the following days:
<ul>add a functional photo gallery to my page</ul>
<ul>apply a sliding navigation bar with multiple trees</ul>
<ul>create a signup/login</ul>
<ul>relaunch the site as an actual blog</ul>

Afterwards, I think I am going to try to move on to create some simple games that may partially function.
