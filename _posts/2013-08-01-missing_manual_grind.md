Was able to put about 3 hours into the _MM (Missing Manual)_. The books pace is really slow and it doesn’t really teach much about how js actually works, but just uses plugins for everything. Not sure if that’s a good or bad thing? Gotta have patience I suppose. I decided to skim the book more and put useful bookmarks and summaries of each chapter on my google docs. I guess unless I really start “building” and applying the principles, I’m not gonna get better at this.

**Project Ideas:**

-  Create a similar slideshow using the anythingslider plugin for the cardiotronic website.
-  change default color schemes.
-  create a pong game
