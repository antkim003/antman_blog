Kind of went around in circles today trying to figure out how to set up jekyll for my blog. It’s a lot more confusing than I thought. It looks like using bootstrapper will be an “easy” way out of it. At this point, I guess I can try to understand the code and downsize the many pages it has into a separate file and make it my own. Uh oh.... programming is starting to get confusing! Actually building stuff is a lot harder. I have to make sure to do things methodically. I should take a break now...
