Okay, I can see how I can get overwhelmed by all the functionality of jekyll. I should really just focus on getting the content out with the bare minimum. I’m not sure if I even have a clear vision of how I want to categorize my posts or if it’s gonna make organizational sense. Also, I wanted to stay away from using a framework, but with my current depth of knowledge, it’ll take too much time to not use anything. I have come across two different ones. Looks like bootstrap is kind of a starter kit to using jekyll. I’ll use this and then maybe check out octopress as I learn more about different functionalities. 
I need to push out something today regardless.  Hopefully get this done in the next two hours! 
Here’s the map for today’s tasks:

*  Get familiar with bootstrap... launch site with minimal css designs
*  upload all the posts on gdocs onto the site</li>
*  Some side terms/things i dont know. What is sass?
*  GET more acclaimated with github
*  check out pinboard
*  what is .haml?
