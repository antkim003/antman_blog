It’s been awhile since I wrote in this. In the last 20 days or so I have been working on Javascript & jQuery: The Missing Manual 2nd edition at a snails pace.... I got through 8 chapters with a rudimentary understanding of jquery and javascript. So far, I am kind of able to create navigation scroll downs and a dynamic picture viewer. All through using different javascript plugins. 

Extracurriculars have taken alot of time. But still isn’t the primary reason of slowing down. It’s most likely that I am not managing my time well. A lot of time is wasted getting distracted with other things. 

Personal Thoughts for August
My main focus in the month of August is to get rid of some of these distractions and fill it with more programming. After that, I’ll have a better assessment of if I ‘really’ don’t have enough time. I have gotten a bit better at saying at no to certain events (which I’m really bad at). Also, I really hope to stop smoking today. That when I do crack, it really torments me because I am letting so many people and God down including myself. 

Goals for August
[Jennifer Dewalt Blog.](http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/) I came upon this blog of a programmer who’s doing 180 websites in 180 days... It’s intriguing and definitely a sign that this is doable. Maybe I will try this in a less ambitious schedule, but first things first. I firmly believe in creating a good foundation first (perhaps it’ll take longer) but I think it’s best for the long run. So, for me it’s back to finishing the book missing manual.

-  Finish missing manual
-  Start Eloquent Javascript 
-  Apply the things I learned to the website, add more pages, and maybe think of some game projects to do.
-  Keep logging everything - make it a habit. 

Project ideas
Create a map with pings on all the cities I’ve been to in America!
