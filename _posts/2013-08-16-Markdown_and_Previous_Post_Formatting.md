It's Friday. I learned more about markdown and the symbols you use to do simple things within it through [a cheatsheet at mashery.com](http://support.mashery.com/docs/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet). At first, I didn't know how to format things to be inside code, ordered lists, unordered lists, etc. I can see it the convenience it provides for coders. I am currently using markdown on textmate, which seems to work fine. 

Not so productive today, just edited my old posts using the markdown shortcuts instead of actally putting in <code><li></code>.
