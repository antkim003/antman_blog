It's Friday, got some practice in this morning creating a random background color generator. I got my inspiration and direction from [Jennifer Dewalt's Blog](http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/47067044924/day-3-a-little-bit-of-js). And then came across this [post](http://www.paulirish.com/2009/random-hex-color-code-snippets/), which looked intimidating at first, but I think I get it.
