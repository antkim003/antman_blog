      <p>It’s Friday. I learned more about markdown and the symbols you use to do simple things within it through <a href="http://support.mashery.com/docs/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet">a cheatsheet at mashery.com</a>. At first, I didn’t know how to format things to be inside code, ordered lists, unordered lists, etc. I can see it the convenience it provides for coders. I am currently using markdown on textmate, which seems to work fine. </p>

<p>Not so productive today, just edited my old posts using the markdown shortcuts instead of actally putting in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>. </p>

      <p>Today, I was able to work through the code to get the tags to work correctly on the blog site. Not much time to program today. </p>

<p>I should apply some of javascript/jQuery knowledge to create a categorizer that will toggle dynamically between certain topics on the archive page. As far as I know, this will require both jQuery and AJAX to display the data without reloading the page. I’ll have to look at someone else’s source code to figure this out. <a href="https://github.com/mottram/mottram">mottr.am</a> has this functionality enabled on their archives page. </p>

<p><strong>Questions I need to find answers to:</strong></p>

    <div class="item_content">
      <p>So after fiddling with the CSS and trying to get the archive page to display the dates organized by year, I finally figured out a work around. This is the first actual post I am writing in Markdown format. All the previous ones were already written and were just copied and pasted onto a page. Going forward, these posts will have more logical sense since I know people are going to read it!</p>

<p>There were a couple things I really struggled with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>the css to indent the month and date <a href="www.projectantman.com/archive/">on the archive page</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>getting the archive page to organize by year using the a ruby extension <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdaihl/1200663">here</a></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For problem 1, I tried to add css <code>padding-left:</code> to the code to the class ‘this’ as shown below because I ran my site on a local server and clicked ‘inspect element.’ It showed that the class ‘this’ was created for the specific archive posts. So I added this code below:</p>

<pre><code>ul .this {
    padding-left: 5em;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>But it wouldn’t change anything so I just took out the <code>padding-left: 0px;</code> declared on the ul css. This put an automatic indentation on all unordered lists by default, which is the current state it’s in now. </p>

<p>For problem 2, I couldn’t understand how the ruby extension worked. I tried to look at some of the other blogs using jekyll engine <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites">here</a>. It was taking too long to figure it out so I found another workaround that didn’t use any kind of ruby extensions. I found an alternate solution on another site, but I forgot the reference. For the life of me, I couldn’t get the first header to post the current year, so it was manually entered. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;section id="archive"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2013&lt;/h2&gt;
  {.% for post in site.posts %}
  {.% unless post.next %}
&lt;ul class="this"&gt;
  {.% else %}
  {.% capture year %}{.{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{.% endcapture %}
  {.% capture nyear %}{.{ post.next.date | date: '%Y' }}{.% endcapture %}
  {.% if year != nyear %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;{.{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="past"&gt;
  {.% endif %}
  {.% endunless %}
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;time&gt;{.{ post.date | date:"%d %b" }}&lt;/time&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="{.{ post.url }}"&gt;{.{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  {.% endfor %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Oh well, I am happy to have it up and running at the least. It’s time to add some features as time goes on and work on some other projects!</p>

      <p>Okay, I can see how I can get overwhelmed by all the functionality of jekyll. I should really just focus on getting the content out with the bare minimum. I’m not sure if I even have a clear vision of how I want to categorize my posts or if it’s gonna make organizational sense. Also, I wanted to stay away from using a framework, but with my current depth of knowledge, it’ll take too much time to not use anything. I have come across two different ones. Looks like bootstrap is kind of a starter kit to using jekyll. I’ll use this and then maybe check out octopress as I learn more about different functionalities. 
I need to push out something today regardless.  Hopefully get this done in the next two hours! 
Here’s the map for today’s tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get familiar with bootstrap… launch site with minimal css designs</li>
  <li>upload all the posts on gdocs onto the site&lt;/li&gt;</li>
  <li>Some side terms/things i dont know. What is sass?</li>
  <li>GET more acclaimated with github</li>
  <li>check out pinboard</li>
  <li>what is .haml?</li>

      <p>Started the codeschool modules on jQuery… it’s definitely a review and in some sense, a more indepth coverage jQuery. I think MM was a little dated on certain things you can do with jQuery. Still, it’s good to have that background moving forward. In general, the concepts and syntax are getting more complicated. It’s not as easy to wrap my head around some of the concepts, or why some syntax is written the way it is. Following jennifer dewalt’s blog, I’m starting to grasp conceptually how to go about making some of the different things shes making.</p>

<p>I think its time to start my own projects!</p>

<p>First off, today’s task list for programming:</p>

  <li>finish codeschool jquery modules</li>
  <li>research different blog interfaces and create a new design for my site</li>
  <li>of course doing regular cardiotronic work</li>

      <p>Kind of went around in circles today trying to figure out how to set up jekyll for my blog. It’s a lot more confusing than I thought. It looks like using bootstrapper will be an “easy” way out of it. At this point, I guess I can try to understand the code and downsize the many pages it has into a separate file and make it my own. Uh oh…. programming is starting to get confusing! Actually building stuff is a lot harder. I have to make sure to do things methodically. I should take a break now…</p>

      <p>Finished the MM yesterday. I think I have a rough understanding of the concepts on how webpages are made to be dynamic using JS and jQ. I can vaguely see how I can create the webpages that I want. I guess the next step now is to start creating some stuff! First off, I should use all the jQ plugins from the tutorial to my website. </p>

<p>I’ll write some of the things I want to accomplish in the following days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add a functional photo gallery to my page</li>
  <li>apply a sliding navigation bar with multiple trees</li>
  <li>create a signup/login</li>
  <li>relaunch the site as an actual blog</li>

<p>Afterwards, I think I am going to try to move on to create some simple games that may partially function. </p>

      <p>Was able to put about 3 hours into the <em>MM (Missing Manual)</em>. The books pace is really slow and it doesn’t really teach much about how js actually works, but just uses plugins for everything. Not sure if that’s a good or bad thing? Gotta have patience I suppose. I decided to skim the book more and put useful bookmarks and summaries of each chapter on my google docs. I guess unless I really start “building” and applying the principles, I’m not gonna get better at this.</p>

  <li>Create a similar slideshow using the anythingslider plugin for the cardiotronic website.</li>
  <li>change default color schemes.</li>

      <p>It’s been awhile since I wrote in this. In the last 20 days or so I have been working on Javascript &amp; jQuery: The Missing Manual 2nd edition at a snails pace…. I got through 8 chapters with a rudimentary understanding of jquery and javascript. So far, I am kind of able to create navigation scroll downs and a dynamic picture viewer. All through using different javascript plugins. </p>

<p>Extracurriculars have taken alot of time. But still isn’t the primary reason of slowing down. It’s most likely that I am not managing my time well. A lot of time is wasted getting distracted with other things. </p>

<p>Personal Thoughts for August
My main focus in the month of August is to get rid of some of these distractions and fill it with more programming. After that, I’ll have a better assessment of if I ‘really’ don’t have enough time. I have gotten a bit better at saying at no to certain events (which I’m really bad at). Also, I really hope to stop smoking today. That when I do crack, it really torments me because I am letting so many people and God down including myself. </p>

<p>Goals for August
<a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/">Jennifer Dewalt Blog.</a> I came upon this blog of a programmer who’s doing 180 websites in 180 days… It’s intriguing and definitely a sign that this is doable. Maybe I will try this in a less ambitious schedule, but first things first. I firmly believe in creating a good foundation first (perhaps it’ll take longer) but I think it’s best for the long run. So, for me it’s back to finishing the book missing manual.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish missing manual</li>
  <li>Start Eloquent Javascript </li>
  <li>Apply the things I learned to the website, add more pages, and maybe think of some game projects to do.</li>
  <li>Keep logging everything - make it a habit. </li>
</ul>

<p>Project ideas
Create a map with pings on all the cities I’ve been to in America!</p>

      <p>today, i finally committed to pursuing a career in development…. I am going to document all my thoughts and actions in this whole journey. </p>

<p>I bought my first domain name and registered with a webhost off hostmetro.com! www.projectantman.com. it doesn’t do anything right now, but definitely will have some promise soon.. $60….</p>

<p>So after talking to Dan, he suggested I make a homepage. I’m guessing he meant from scratch or as close to scratch as I could…</p>

<p>I realized I have a straight idea on how to this… couple of the first questions that come up seem so stupid: </p>

<p>Am I supposed to install a framework into my server?? 
Is it supposed to be done through pure html code??
how do i upload or edit code?? 
I wonder how it ties into what I’m doing with rails tutorial?? Can I use that to create/edit homepages with the same capabilities if I were to build it up from scratch??</p>

<p>Thank the lord for the internet! I think I’ll be a little closer as I answer these questions…</p>

<p>On a sidenote… I’ll try to push through the rails tutorial and finish by the end of this weekend.</p>
